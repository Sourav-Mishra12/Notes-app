# NOTES APP 

# it is a notes app that will have basic operations like adding , viewing and deleting notes by entering the index number
# also i have learnt a little bit of streamlit so i will be adding its functionalities into it
# not using any kind of module like json,os,pathlib because i want to keep it simple and practice the concepts of file i/o
# do not judge me i am just a beginner :)
